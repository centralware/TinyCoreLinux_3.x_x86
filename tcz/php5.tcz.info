Comments:	This package requires libxslt, mysql, gmp,
		bsddb, libgdbm, curl, libltdl, libiconv, 
		libmcrypt, bzip2-lib, and their deps.
		
		Other extensions may be needed for additional
		functionality. ie libmhash, gettext
		
		8546/8615 tests passed, 99.2% pass rate.
		
		The php.ini configuration file is found in
		/usr/local/lib. This file can be editted to
		change the runtime options.
		
		Can be used with apache2 or lighttpd for a
		HTTP/PHP server (probably others too).
		
		For lighttpd (from lighttpd wiki):
			make sure mod_fastcgi is loaded in your 
			lighttpd.conf:
				server.modules = (
					"mod_fastcgi",
					)
				 
			Then add this basic section to the same file:
				fastcgi.server = ( ".php" => (( 
					"bin-path" => "/usr/local/bin/php-cgi",
					"socket" => "/tmp/php.socket" 
					)))
			
			Other server modules that may be needed:
				mod_auth
				mod_access
				mod_accesslog
				mod_rewrite
		
		
		For apache2:
			Make sure cgi.force_redirect = 0 in php.ini.
			The following, or similar, must be included 
			in the httpd.conf file:
				ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/cgi-bin/"
				AddHandler cgi-script .php
				Action cgi-script "/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"
			The ExecCGI option must be enabled for the
			HTTP server's root directory (htdocs).
			A shebang for php-cgi must also be included.
				#!/usr/local/bin/php-cgi
