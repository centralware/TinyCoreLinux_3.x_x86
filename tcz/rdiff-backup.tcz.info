Title:          rdiff-backup.tcz 
Description:    rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly
                over a network. The target directory ends up a copy of
                the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored
                in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so
                you can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea
                is to combine the best features of a mirror and an
                incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves
                subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions,
                uid/gid ownership, modification times, extended
                attributes, acls, and resource forks. Also, rdiff-backup
                can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe,
                like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to
                securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and
                only the differences will be transmitted. Finally,
                rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings have sensical
                defaults.

Comments:       Using Linux as the backup destination works well.
                Using Windows as the backup destination does not work
                too good at the moment.
                Backup can be initiated from either source or
                destination.
