Comments:       Mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' 
		programs in a single network diagnostic tool.
                As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between 
		the host mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.
		After it determines the address of each network hop between 
		the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one 
		to determine the quality of the link to each machine. As it does
		this, it prints running statistics about each machine.
