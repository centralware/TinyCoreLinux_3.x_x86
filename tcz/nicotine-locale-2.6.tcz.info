Comments:       nicotine is a client for the SoulSeek 
		filesharing network. It was "forked"
		(and thus reuses a lot of code) from the
		PySoulSeek project by Alexander Kanavin,
		and features (among other things) a
		completely new graphical user interface.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
