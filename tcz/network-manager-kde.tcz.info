Extension_by:	Arslan S.
Comments:	This is a KDE4 plasma widget and a client to the NetworkManager. This is not intended to work
		for environments other than KDE4. So this extension is only for KDE4 desktop.

		All you need to do is to start NetworkManager daemon on startup, knetworkmanager is automatically
		started by KDE4.

		To start NetworkManager add to /opt/bootlocal.sh :
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus restart
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/NetworkManager start

		This extension is PPI compatible.
