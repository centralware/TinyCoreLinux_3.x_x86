Comments:       Fastest full-featured browser available.
                In /usr/local for persistent configurations,
		in other words, PPI compatible.
		
		This extension does not conflicts with any ohter opera##.tcz
		(use settings in ~/.opera-next)

                Opera has a low-ram mode (e-mail, IRC, functionality
		is removed), the icon launches this low-ram mode.
		Full Browser is available from the menu.
