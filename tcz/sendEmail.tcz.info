Description:    SendEmail is a lightweight, command line SMTP email client.
                If you have the need to send email from a command line,
                this free program is perfect: simple to use and feature
                rich. It was designed to be used in bash scripts, batch
                files, Perl programs and web sites, but is quite adaptable
                and will likely meet your requirements. SendEmail is written
                in Perl and is unique in that it requires NO MODULES. It has
                an intuitive and flexible set of command-line options,
                making it very easy to learn and use. SendEmail is licensed
