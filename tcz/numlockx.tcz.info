Comments:       This little thingy allows you to start X with NumLock on (which
                is a feature that a lot of people seem to miss and nobody really
                knew how to achieve this).
                
                This code relies on X extensions called XTest and XKB, so you need
                to have at least one of these X extensions installed.
                
                Usage: numlockx [on|off|toggle]
                on     - turns NumLock on in X (default)
                off    - turns NumLock off in X
                toggle - toggles the NumLock on and off in X
