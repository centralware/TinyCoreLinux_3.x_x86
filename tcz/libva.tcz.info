Title:          libva.tcz
Description:    The main motivation for VAAPI (Video Acceleration API) is to enable hardware accelerated 
		video decode/encode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, Motion Compensation etc.) for the 
		prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, and VC-1/VMW3). 
		Extending XvMC was considered, but due to its original design for MPEG-2 MotionComp only, it 
		made more sense to design an interface from scratch that can fully expose the video decode 
		capabilities in today's GPUs.
