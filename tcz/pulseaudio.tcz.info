Comments:       PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it is a proxy 
                for sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your
                sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware.
                Things like transferring the audio to a different machine, changing
                the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds into one
                are easily achieved using a sound server
                ----------
                howto:
                alsa needs to be working for whatever sound device you have
                exit to console
                create ~/.X.d/dbus containing:
                "dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session"
                startx
                $ pulseaudio -vv [to test]
                create ~/.X.d/pulseaudio containing:
                "pulseaudio -D" [once tested]
                ----------
                if a bluetooth sound devices is paired and configured, pulseaudio
                should find it automatically if the daemon is running
                ----------
                use pavucontrol to switch source & control volume
                ----------
