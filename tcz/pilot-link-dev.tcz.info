Comments:	Pilot-link is a collection of tools for communication
		with a Palm OS device. Pilot-link supports Linux, OSX,
		and theoretically Windows via Cygwin. Pilot Link is
		used by J-Pilot and other GUI tools. 
		
		This version includes significant changes to support  
		libusb-1.0 and Tiny Core. Tested on TC 3.1 with a 
		Palm Tungsten E.

		This is the development extension. It includes headers,
		binaries other than pilot-xfer, and support files for
		dlpsh and the pilot-link debugger.
