Comments:	This extension requires Xorg! It has 3D, cups, sane, ssl, ... well it seems to support almost everything in the universe. Steps:

			1. In winecfg under Graphics uncheck 'Allow window manager to control windows'
			2. wine myapp.exe
			3. Check out wine-gecko.tcz and/or winetricks.tcz to get browser support and/or winetricks.
			4. Example for winetricks.tcz:
				$ winetricks list-download
				$ winetricks corefonts
