Comments:       TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files..
                ..by converting them into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data..
                ..along with digital instrument data files, then it synthesizes..
                ..them in real-time, and plays. It can not only play sounds,
                but also can save the generated waveforms.
