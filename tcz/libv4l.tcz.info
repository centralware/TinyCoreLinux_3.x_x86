Comments:	v4l-utils is a collection of various video4linux (V4L) 
		and DVB utilities. libv4l is an accompanying collection 
		of libraries that adds a thin abstraction layer on top of 
		video4linux2 (V4L2) devices. The purpose of this layer 
		is to make it easy for application writers to support a 
		wide variety of devices without having to write separate 
		code for different devices in the same class. It consists 
		of 3 different libraries. libv4lconvert offers functions to 
		convert from any (known) pixel format to 
		V4l2_PIX_FMT_BGR24 or V4l2_PIX_FMT_YUV420. 
		libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 
		devices, independent of the drivers for those devices 
		supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many v4l2 drivers do not). 
		libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, 
		while adding support for the application transparent 
		libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
