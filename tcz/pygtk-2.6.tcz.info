Comments:	PyGTK lets you to easily create programs
		with a graphical user interface using the
		Python programming language. The underlying GTK+
		library provides all kind of visual elements and
		utilities for it and, if needed, you can develop
		full featured applications for the GNOME Desktop.

		PyGTK applications are truly multiplatform and 
		they're able to run, unmodified, on Linux, Windows,
		MacOS X and other platforms.

		Other distinctive features of PyGTK are,
		besides its ease of use and rapid prototyping,
		its first class accesibility support or the capability
		to deal with complex multilingual or bidirectional 
		text for fully localized applications.
