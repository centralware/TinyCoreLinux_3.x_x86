Comments:	ser2net provides a way for a user to connect from a network connection to a serial port.  I tried all the other ones I could find and found them lacking, so I wrote my own.  It provides all the serial port setup, a configuration file to configure the ports, a control login for modifying port parameters, monitoring ports, and controlling ports.
