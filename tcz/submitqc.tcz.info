Comments:       This is used to audit extensions before
		submission.  Just open a terminal in the
		same directory as the extensions you are
		wanting to check and this tool will tell
		you of any issues with the structure of 
		the extensions being checked.  "submitqc"
		is the command to run. Some specific uses
		are listed below if the entire audit is 
		not needed:
		#  To check dep files only:
		submitqc checkdep
		#  To check info files only:
		submitqc checkinfo
		#  To check for maintainership only:
		submitqc checkmaintainer
		----
		Results are echoed to the terminal in progress but
		to see the specific results of each check
		performed, look in the /tmp/submitqc directory
		to see the results of checks that are in question

Change-log:     ----
