Comments:	Pilot-link is a collection of tools for communication
		with a Palm OS device. Pilot-link supports Linux, OSX,
		and theoretically Windows via Cygwin. Pilot Link is
		used by J-Pilot and other GUI tools.  

		This extension includes significant changes to support  
		libusb-1.0 and Tiny Core 3.1. Tested on TC 3.1 with a 
		Palm Tungsten E.

		Use "pilot-xfer" from the CLI to interact with your  
		handheld. Example for 'list':

			pilot-xfer -p usb: -l -t 5

		For help, see the online man pages or use pilot-xfer 
		without arguments. 

		This is the base extension. It includes libraries,
		the pilot-xfer binary, and source file for libusb.c.
		Headers and other binaries are in the dev extension.
