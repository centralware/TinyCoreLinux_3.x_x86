Description:    X.org development files
Version:        7.4-2 (1.6.1)
Author:         X organization
Original-site:  http://www.x.org
Copying-policy: MIT
Size:		1.7M
Extension_by:   Curaga
Comments:       You need these to compile any graphical apps.
		Depends on pixman, fontconfig, and expat.
-
		Known workarounds you might need:
		PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
		CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
		LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
-
		If you want to compile extensions not dependent on
		Xorg, only load this -dev extension and not Xorg.
		Advanced functionality is in static libs in this 
		extension, but in dynamic libs in Xorg.
