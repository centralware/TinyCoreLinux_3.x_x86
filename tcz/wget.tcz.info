Extension_by:   Jason W
Comments:       This is the GNU version of wget that replaces the
		busybox version.  The install script in this extension
		installs wget into /usr/local/bin and deletes the 
		busybox symlink in /usr/bin.  To restore the busybox
		version, just use the command as root:
		# ln -s /bin/busybox /usr/bin/wget
		This extension depends on the openssl-0.9.8k
		extension.
