		The first time it is good to start 
                # wvdialconf , this command will try to
                automatically configure settings for your
                modem in /etc/wvdial.conf ; this file along
                with /etc/resolv.conf (containing the dns) may
                be placed in /opt/.filetool.lst to store your
                settings.
                # wvdial command requires root privileges to
                start correctly, after a first successfully
                launched but interrupted for incorrect
                settings of wvdial.conf, you may not be able
                to relaunch the program correctly; try to reuse 
                wvdialconf to unlock the situation and remember
                that it overwrite wvdial.conf.

                In case you need to use concomitantly with
                usb_modeswitch for internet key, I recommend
                installing this in boot mode and restart the
                distro. This is to prevent any inconvenient
                with udev.
