Description:    
		OpenTyrian is a port of the DOS shoot-em-up Tyrian. Jason Emery generously gave the OpenTyrian
		developers a copy of the Tyrian 2.1 source code, which has since been ported from Turbo Pascal
		to C. The port uses SDL, making it easily cross-platform.

		Tyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter. The story is set in 20,031 where you 
		play as Trent Hawkins, a skilled fighter-pilot employed to fight Microsol and save the galaxy.
