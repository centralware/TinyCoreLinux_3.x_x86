		---------------------------------------------------------------
		Usage:  nrg2iso image.nrg image.iso


		Note:

		NOT INTENDED FOR AUDIO CDs OR MULTITRACK IMAGES.

		NRG is a proprietary variant of the common ISO format.

		nrg2iso reads all .nrg files as disc at once (DAO). Images with
		a single track can be burned as usual.

		However, track at once (TAO) images will fail.

		Trying to burn multitrack .nrg images converted to .iso will result
		in getting only the first track recorded.
