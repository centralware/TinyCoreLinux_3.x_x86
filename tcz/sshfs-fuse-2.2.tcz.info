                ----------------------------------------------------
                Create a mountpoint in your home directory. Then
                mount the remote host with:
                
		$ sshfs hostname mountpoint
		
		Example:
		-------
		$ mkdir /home/tc/work-pc
		$ sshfs user@192.168.1.20:/home/user /home/tc/work-pc
		
		Note: 
		----
		When connecting to a host for the first time you will
		be greeted with either:
				
		 - an authentication request, or
		 - a plain cursor
		
		In both cases, just type in the word 'yes' and hit 
		enter to continue.
		
		------------------------------------------------------
		For more options use:
		
		$ sshfs -h
