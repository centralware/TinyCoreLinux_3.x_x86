Comments:       The latest watcher, now available as an extension. :P
		Changes from 1.6:
		- battery support
		- no borders (looking better on non-swallowing WMs)
-
		Use the X standard -g option to position watcher where-ever
		wanted. X counts from top-left, so watcher in top-left corner:
		watcher -g +0+0
		
		Top-right would be "-0+0", bottom left "+0-0", bottom right 
		"-0-0".
-
		To start watcher on X start, add to .xsession:
		[ $(which watcher) ] && watcher -g +0-0 &
-
		This extension is PPI compatible.
