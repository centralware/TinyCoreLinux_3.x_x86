Comments:	This is a panel applet and a client to the NetworkManager. So you need a panel or a system tray
		and the NetworkManager daemon running.

		To start NetworkManager add to your /opt/bootlocal.sh :
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus restart
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/NetworkManager start

		network-manager-gnome (nm-applet) starts automatically in GNOME desktop. So you don't need to do anything
		else than starting NetworkManager daemon as described above.
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Running network-manager-gnome in other desktop environments :

		network-manager-gnome should be able to run in LXDE or XFCE provided that the required daemons are running.
		This applet uses gnome-keyring to store passwords. So you need gnome-keyring for persistent passwords.
		When loaded gnome-keyring daemon should be automatically started because of xdg autostart entries.
		If gnome-keyring is not automatically started then add the command below to your desktop startup commands :
			/usr/local/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets

		nm-applet should also be automatically started, If it is not running :
			nm-applet --sm-disable *

		* Due to a problem you need to execute nm-applet as root but then gnome-keyring does not store user passwords
			sudo nm-applet --sm-disable
		You need to start your desktop session with ck-launch-session (ConsoleKit) to be able to run nm-applet as standart user and gnome-keyring to work.


		Optional dependencies:
			-gnome-bluetooth
			-mobile-broadband-provider-info
			-gnome-keyring
			-notification-daemon

		This extension is PPI compatible.
