Comments:       This was compiled from the Tiny Core kernel source and
                config file, by enabling staging drivers and then enabling
                the rt2860 driver.
                It was tested successfully on an eeepc 1000H.
                Note that the iwpriv based WPA configuration samples from
                the 2.x version of the extension do not work anymore, but
                wpa_supplicant seems to work fine now.
                This extension is PPI-compatible.
