Comments:       the foomatic-rip filter is used by some printer driver packages
                requires libgs.tcz
Change-log:     2009/10/12 - first version - removed foomatic-rip from CUPS package
                           - foomatic v4 is now a binary and does not require Perl
Current:        2009/10/15 - removed libgs and changed to a .tcz extension
                           - libgs is now a separate extension to maintain compatibility with gsview
