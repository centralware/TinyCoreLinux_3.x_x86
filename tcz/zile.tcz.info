Comments:	GNU Zile is a lightweight Emacs clone. Zile is short for 
                Zile Is Lossy Emacs. Zile has been written to be as 
                similar as possible to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel 
                at home.
                Zile has all of Emacs's basic editing features: 
                - It is 8-bit clean (though it currently lacks Unicode 
                  support).
                - The number of editing buffers and windows is only 
                  limited by available memory and screen space respectively. 
                - Registers, minibuffer completion and auto fill are 
                  available. 
                - Function and variable names are identical with Emacs's.

                However, all of this is packed into a program which 
                typically compiles to about 130Kb.

		This extension is PPI compatible.
