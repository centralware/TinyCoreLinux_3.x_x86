Comments:       Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard
                between multiple computers with different operating systems,
                each with its own display, without special hardware.
                It's intended for users with multiple computers on their 
                desk since each system uses its own monitor(s).

                Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving
                the mouse off the edge of your screen. Synergy also merges
                the clipboards of all the systems into one, allowing
                cut-and-paste between systems. Furthermore, it synchronizes
                screen savers so they all start and stop together and, if
                screen locking is enabled, only one screen requires a
                password to unlock them all.

                Includes both the synergys server and synergyc client.
                See site for Win/MacOSX/*nix support.

                Notes:
                - if your hostname is not the same as the client name,
                  you can pass it with "--name myclientname"
                - ssh tunnels should be used in conjunction with this
                  unless the systems are on a trusted network
