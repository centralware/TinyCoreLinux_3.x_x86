Comments:	
		When using LXDE I missed easy access to a number of TC/MC
		specific tools.
		This extension provides access to these tools via the desktop's
		applications menu. The tools appear under a sub menu to the
		System Tools entry in the applications menu.
		
		Only tested with LXDE in TC and MC but should work with any
		freedesktop.org compliant desktop.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
