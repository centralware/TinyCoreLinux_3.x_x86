Comments:       This extension will set up a dial up internet connection.

		There are menu entries for setup, connecting and disconnecting.

		Files that need to be in backup for configuration to persist
                across reboots:

		etc/ppp
		etc/resolv.conf
		usr/local/sbin/ppp-go

		If you also include usr/local/bin/ppp-off, you can remove
		pppsetup.tcz from the tce directory after setting up the
		connection. If you do, menu entries are also removed. So connect
		to the internet by typing "sudo ppp-go" in the terminal, and
		disconnect by typing "sudo ppp-off."

		If you are using tclocal mounting, then /etc/ppp and
		/etc/resolv.conf are the only files that need to be backed up.

		This extension requires pppd.tcz.
		This extension is NOT PPI compatible.
