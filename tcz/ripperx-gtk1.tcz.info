Comments:       This extension requires the id3lib.tcz, gtk1.tcz,
		glib1.tcz extensions to operate.  Helpful for encoding are
		lame.tcz, libvorbis.tcz + vorbis-tools.tcz, and flac.tcz.
		cdplay.tcz is needed for the play function of CD's.  Make
		sure your CD audio is not muted in alsamixer before using.
Change-log:     2008/08/22 First version
		2008/10/14 Added JWM menu.
        	2008/12/11 Rebuilt for i486, size, cramfs.
		2010/12/09 Rebuilt to correct crashing,
		renamed to all lowercase for simplicity.
		2010/12/10 Update to 2.7.0 and fix cddb entries.
Current:	2010/12/13 Now self contained in /usr/local/ripperx-gtk1
			   as to not conflict with a future gtk2 version.
