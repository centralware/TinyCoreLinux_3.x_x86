Comments:	This archive contains bindings for the GLib, GObject and GIO,
		to be used in Python. It is a fairly complete set of bindings,
		it's already rather useful, and is usable to write moderately
		complex programs.  (see the examples directory for some examples
		of the simpler programs you could write).
		
		If you have any enhancements or bug reports, please file them in
		bugzilla at:
		http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=pygobject

		If you have a patch, file the bug first and then use the "create new
		attachment" link on the bug's info page.  My preferred format for
		patches is unified diff format (ie. diff -u).  Please don't send me
		diffs which don't have any context, as these make it very difficult to
		see what the patch does.
