Comments:       You can use Monit to monitor daemon processes or similar programs running on localhost. Monit is 
particular useful for monitoring daemon processes, such as those started at system boot time from /etc/init.d/. For 
instance sendmail, sshd, apache and mysql.

In difference to many monitoring systems, Monit can act if an error situation should occur, e.g.; if sendmail is not 
running, Monit can start sendmail again automatically or if apache is using too much resources (e.g. if a DoS attack 
is in progress) Monit can stop or restart apache and send you an alert message. Monit can also monitor process 
characteristics, such as; how much memory or cpu cycles a process is using.

You can also use Monit to monitor files, directories and filesystems on localhost. Monit can monitor these items for 
changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes. This is also useful for security reasons - you 
can monitor the md5 or sha1 checksum of files that should not change and get an alert or perform an action if they 
should change.

Monit can monitor network connections to various servers, either on localhost or on remote hosts. TCP, UDP and Unix 
Domain Sockets are supported. Network test can be performed on a protocol level; Monit has built-in tests for the 
main Internet protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP etc. Even if a protocol is not supported you can still test the server as 
you can configure Monit to send any data and test the response from the server.
