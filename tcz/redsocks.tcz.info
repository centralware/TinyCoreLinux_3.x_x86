Comments:       From http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks:

                  This tool allows you to redirect any TCP connection
                  to SOCKS or HTTPS proxy using your firewall, so
                  redirection is system-wide.

                See the /usr/local/share/redsocks directory for a
                README and sample configuration file.

                See https://gist.github.com/1287517 or download
                http://gist.github.com/raw/1287517/via-ssh.sh for an
                example script that uses redsocks, OpenSSH, and
                iptables to redirect all TCP traffic temporarily to a
                server on which you have an account with ssh access.
                For example, executing

                  ./via-ssh.sh user@server:port

                at the command line will redirect all of your TCP
                traffic until you enter Control-C to terminate the
                redirection. 

                Please see the caution in the script about DNS queries.
