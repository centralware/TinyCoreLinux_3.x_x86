Size: 		2.5M		
Extension_by:   dentonlt
Comments:       The base extension requires GTK2 and its dependencies.
		The extra extension requires the base extension and,
		optionally, Perl for screen savers with custom text. 

		Neither extension includes OpenGL savers. This version 
		was compiled and tested on TC 3.0.

		This extra extension has some 100 screen savers.
		
		To start at boot, put the following in 
		~/.X.d/xscreensaver:
		   xscreensaver -nosplash &
		
		To configure, use 
		   xscreensaver-command -prefs
		
		In LXDE, a menu item is added under settings.
