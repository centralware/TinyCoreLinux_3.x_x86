Comments:       This is the more frequently released kernel modules
		available directly from the Alsa project to provide
		more up to date support for newer hardware.  Install
		this extension before installing any other alsa related
		extension to ensure that the modules dependency is
		satisfied, otherwise alsa-modules-2.6.33.3-tinycore
		will get installed automatically as a dependency of 
		the alsa.tcz extension and will conflict with this one.
