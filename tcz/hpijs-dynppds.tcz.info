                This extension only works with CUPS 1.3.11. It is designed for
                HP owners who just want a basic printer driver and do not need the
                full HPLIP multi-function package. Be aware that some of the printers
                listed in HPIJS actually require CUPS 1.4 and HPLIP. Check out:
