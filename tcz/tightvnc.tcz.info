Comments:       Xvnc creates a virtual screen, so you can't
		use it to control a real one; you'll also need
		to pick a screen number that is not in use on the
		computer you will run Xvnc on.
-
		Start the server with:
		Xvnc :1
-
		To start some apps on screen 1, such as JWM:
		DISPLAY=:1.0 jwm
-
		Then you can connect to it from other machines
		using vncviewer:
		vncviewer 192.168.0.56::5901
