Comments:	This package contains the Siag office suite includeing:
			Siag (Scheme in a Grid) Spreadsheet application
			Egon Animation application //!! This program doesn't yet work.
				It's not a packaging problem it's a known but and it's 
				being worked on ... slowly.
			PW (Pathetic Writer) Word Processor
			XedPlus an awesome text editor
			Xfiler a GUI file manager
			Gvu the image viewer
		This software is nowhere near perfect so give me a email at
		chalbersma.12@westminster-mo.edu when problems come up and I'll 
		do my damndest to make sure that the problem gets fixed (except on Egon I'm going
		to let the devel work on that one :))
