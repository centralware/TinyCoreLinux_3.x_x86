Comments:       Based on Liero gameplay, OpenLierox is an extremely addictive realtime worms 
		shoot-em-up backed by an active gamers community. Dozens of levels and mods 
		are available to provide endless gaming pleasure. 

		You can play it online.

		You need OSS or ALSA for sound.

		If you are having trouble with the sound or want to use another sound device.
		Open up a terminal and try the following.
			"SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dsp AUDIODEV=/dev/dspXXX openlierox"
		Then turn the sound on in the game options->system.

		This is a beta version so it has some known issues. But It is much better
		than the 0.57_rc1 version.

		Xorg is recommended. 

		This extension is PPI compatible.
