Comments:       War is declared ! Have the mascots of your favorite free software titles 
		battle it out in the Wormux arena using dynamite, grenades, baseball bats 
		and other bazookas... Exterminate your opponent in a 2D environment with
		toon-style scenery.

		Each player controls the team of his choice (penguin, gnu, firefox, wilber,...)
		and must destroy his adversary using more or less casual weapons.

		You need PULSEAUDIO, ALSA or OSS for sound.

		Xorg is recommended.

		This extension is PPI compatible.
