                  ntpclient is an NTP (RFC-1305) client for unix-alike
                  computers. Its functionality is a small subset of
                  xntpd, but IMHO performs better (or at least has the
                  potential to function better) within that limited
                  scope. Since it is much smaller than xntpd, it is
                  also more relevant for embedded computers.

                See http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/README and
                http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/HOWTO for more 
                informtion.

                -----------------------------------------------------

                This extension was built from 

                  http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/ntpclient_2007_365.tar.gz

                using CFLAGS='-march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe'.  The 
                adjtimex command that is normally supplied with 
                ntpclient is part of busybox.

                While this extension can be used as a daemon to adjust 
                the system clock, Chrony is much easier to use.  This
                extension is useful if you want to independently verify
                how well Chrony is working or if you want to set the 
                sytem clock immediately using NTP time.

                Examples:

		$ ntpclient -c 1 -h pool.ntp.org
		 day   second     elapsed    stall     skew  dispersion  freq
		40179 64730.007   52736.0     16.7   -8557.8  57006.8   3254000
 
                The fifth column (skew) gives the approximate offset in 
                microseconds between the system clock and the specified 
                NTP server.

                $ ntpclient -c 10 -i 60 -h pool.ntp.org

                This command will check the time every 60 seconds for 
                10 minutes.

                $ sudo ntpclient -s -c 1 -h pool.ntp.org
               
                This command sets the system clock based on the time 
                returned from the specified NTP server.  Running such
                a command as a cron job is a simple way to keep the 
                system clock reasonably accurate, although time may 
                be stepped backward.
