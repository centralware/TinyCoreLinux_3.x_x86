Version:	0.48.1
Author:		various
Original-site:	http://www.inkscape.org
Copying-policy:	GNU GPL2
Size:		7.4M
Extension_by:	dentonlt
Comments:	Locale/internationalization information for Inkscape. The
		main inkscape.tcz extension contains the Inkscape binaries.

		Inkscape is an open source vector graphics editor, akin to
		CorelDraw, Xara X, etc. Inkscape uses the W3C standard scalable
		vector graphics format.
		
		This is not lightweight. If you only need basic editing,
		consider the inkscapelite extension.
		
		Built and tested on TC3.6rc2 using sv0lli's build tool. Desc
		file available in the TC forum script section.
