Comments:	This is not a stand alone network manager for end users, you need a NetworkManager client.

		There are three clients available :
			-cnetworkmanager (command line interface, but doesn't support static ips yet)
			-network-manager-gnome (GNOME client, This can also be used in LXDE or XFCE provided that the required daemons are running, dbus & gnome-keyring)
			-network-manager-kde (KDE4 client, not intended to work outside KDE4)

		Optional dependencies :
			-modemmanager
			-NetworkManager-openvpn,vpnc,openconnect,pptp

		NetworkManager is controlled by dbus interface with the policies defined
		in the dbus system configuration files (/usr/local/etc/dbus-1/system.d/NetworkManager.conf)
		by default only user=root can own the service, but user=root, group=staff, and
		the users active on console (ConsoleKit) have access for the NetworkManager services.

		To run NetworkManager daemon, put these lines in your /opt/bootlocal.sh :
			#We need to restart dbus daemon
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus restart
			#NetworkManager daemon can be controlled by the init script:
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/NetworkManager start
		
		Important Note: You need to restart dbus daemon If you loaded this extension after dbus daemon started.

		This extension is PPI compatible, If you backup /etc/udev/rules.d/77-nm-olpc-mesh.rules
