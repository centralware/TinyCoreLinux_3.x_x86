Comments:       The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the
                ability to easily extract data from files archived in a single
                zip file. Applications can bundle files into a single zip
                archive and access them. The implementation is based only on
                the (free) subset of compression with the  zlib algorithm which
                is actually used by the zip/unzip tools.
