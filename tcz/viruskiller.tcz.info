Comments:       Protect your files and directories from viruses pouring in your system
		from internet, messenger and other sources. Kill viruses with your 
		kernel laser as much as you can. Use your kernel power and thread blockers wisely.
		And remember no system is safe!

		You need a pointing device such as mouse or touchpad. You also need at least 
		four non empty directories in your homedir in order to play this game. 

		You need OSS or ALSA for sound.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
