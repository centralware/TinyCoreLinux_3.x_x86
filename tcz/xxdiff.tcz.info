Comments:       Xxdiff has reached stable state, and is known 
		to run on many popular unices, including IRIX, 
		Linux, Solaris, HP/UX, DEC Tru64. It has been 
		deployed inside many large organizations and 
		is being actively maintained by its author.
		Features:
		    * Comparing two files, three files, or two 
		      directories (shallow and recursive);
		    * Horizontal diffs highlighting;
		    * Files can be merged interactively and 
		      resulting output visualized and saved;
		    * Has features to assist in performing merge 
		      reviews/policing;
		    * Can unmerge CVS conflicts in automatically 
		      merged file and display them as two files, 
		      to help resolve conflicts;
		    * Uses external diff program to compute differences: 
		      works with GNU diff, SGI diff and ClearCase's cleardiff, 
		      and any other diff whose output is similar to those;
		    * Fully customizable with a resource file;
		    * Look-and-feel similar to Rudy Wortel's/SGI xdiff, 
		      it is desktop agnostic (i.e. will work equally well 
		      with KDE or Gnome);
		    * Features and output that ease integration with scripts.
