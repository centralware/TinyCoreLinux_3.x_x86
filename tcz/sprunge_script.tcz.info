		The command is "sprunge" or "nopaste" (symlink)
		I quote the text of the blog where I found this
		script:
		
		"I discovered the scripting-friendly pastebin
		http://sprunge.us a few days ago via One Thing
		Well. It's extremely convenient to use, but in my
		laziness I've tried to make it even easier.
		Here is a script that will upload to sprunge and
		return the URL. It accepts piped data, STDIN
		redirection, filenames as arguments, and text
		strings as arguments. EDIT: while using the script,
		I just realized that using either form of STDIN
		input (pipe or redirection) will treat tabs as
		spaces.
		While this will occasionally break code, it will
		almost always make it less legible. So, if you
		need to preserve tab whitespace, I suggest using
		a filename as an argument to the script
		(e.g. sprunge myscript.txt). (Click "show source")"
		
		"So, for example, any of the following commands
		would work (I cleverly named the script "sprunge"
		and put it in my $PATH):

ls -lA | sprunge
cat .bashrc | sprunge
sprunge < .bashrc
sprunge .bashrc
sprunge 'if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then echo "everything after the word sprunge will be uploaded as a text string"; fi'
## note that the last line needs to be surrounded by single quotes, because of the semicolons.

		And here's the short description and usage (which
		is included above, but maybe more readable here):
		DESCRIPTION
		Upload data and fetch URL from the pastebin
		http://sprunge.us
 
		USAGE
./sprunge filename.txt
./sprunge text string
./sprunge < filename.txt
piped_data | ./sprunge
 
		NOTES
		----------------------------------------------
		* INPUT METHODS *
		./sprunge can accept piped data, STDIN redirection
		[<filename.txt], text strings following the
		command as arguments, or filenames as arguments.
		Only one of these methods can be used at a time,
		so please see the note on precedence.
 
		* PRECEDENCE *
		STDIN redirection has precedence, then piped input,
		then a filename as an argument, and finally text
		strings as an arguments.
 
		EXAMPLE:
echo piped | "./sprunge" arguments.txt < stdin_redirection.txt
 
		In this example, the contents of
		file_as_stdin_redirection.txt would be uploaded.
		Both the piped_text and the file_as_argument.txt are
		ignored.
		If there is piped input and arguments, the arguments
		will be ignored, and the piped input uploaded.
 
		* FILENAMES *
		If a filename is misspelled or doesn't have the
		necessary path description, it will NOT generate an
		error, but will instead treat it as a text string
		and upload it.
		----------------------------------------------

		Appropriately, I used the script to upload the script
		to sprunge. http://sprunge.us/cXjM is the URL, but
		you can add "?bash" to the end of it to get line
		numbers and syntax highlighting, like so:
		http://sprunge.us/cXjM?bash.
