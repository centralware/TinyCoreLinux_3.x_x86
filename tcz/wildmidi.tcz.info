Comments:       The WildMIDI library uses Gravis Ultrasound patch files to
                convert MIDI files into audio which is them passed back to the
                calling application for further processing or output. 

                Currently there is a small command line player that accompanies
                the library which gives just one example of the use of the 
                WildMIDI library.                
                
                Attention
                ---------
                This program comes without any set of sound fonts (instrument
                patches), but you need these for playing songs. 
                There is another extension (wildmidi-freepats, 29M) which 
                includes a basic free and open set of instrument patches for
                playing most songs in sufficient quality. Load therefore
                "wildmidi-freepats" if you do not have your own instrument 
                patches.

                Usage
                -----
                play midi file from console :
                # wildmidi MIDI_FILE.mid

                convert midi -> wav :
                # wildmidi -o OUTPUT_FILE.wav MIDI_FILE.mid
