Comments:       This extension is PPI compatible.
		This extension can be installed alongside other versions
		of openssl as it is installed into a dedicated directory.
		To use this as openssl, either use the command:
		$ /usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k/bin/openssl
		or add /usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k/bin to the front of your 
		$PATH.  The certs directory is /usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k/etc/ssl/certs.
		To build extensions against this one, you may need to
		use a configure switch like --with-ssl=/usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k.
		Or adding /usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k/lib/pkgconfig to your 
		pkgconfig path.  If you use this extension to build apps against,
		you will need to use a wrapper for the executables in that extension
		to find the right ssl libs.  Here is an example wrapper script for links.
		Just rename /usr/local/bin/links to /usr/local/bin/links-bin and call
		the wrapper /usr/local/bin/links:
		----------
		#!/bin/sh

		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k/lib

		/usr/local/bin/links-bin "$@"

		---------
		That will use the libs in /usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k/lib in priority over	
		those in the system for that app.
