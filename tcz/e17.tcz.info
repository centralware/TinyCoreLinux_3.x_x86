Comments:	For first time setup is necessary to disable wbar,
		or at least move it from the bottom.
		so boot with "noicons" cause the wbar is overlapping the 
		"next" button in the wm wizard.
		In order to have e17 localized u have 3 options:
		1- put this extension in the copy2fs.lst
	        2- create copy2fs.flg
		3- in the e17 configuration, advanced, directory,
		   messages add /usr/local/share/locale
		----------------------
		This extension is PPI compatible
