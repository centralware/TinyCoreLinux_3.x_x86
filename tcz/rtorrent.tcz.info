Comments:       LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix, with a focus on high performance and good code.
                The library differentiates itself from other implementations by transfering directly from file pages to the network stack.
                On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at 3 times the speed of the official client.
                The client uses ncurses and is ideal for use with  screen or dtach.
                It supports saving of sessions and allows the user to add and remove torrents.

                The following patches were applied:
                Colored user interface patch:
                 http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtorrent-color/rtorrent-color/rtorrent-0.8.6-canvas-fix.patch
                Equal operator patch: (needed for automatically Move Completed Torrent Data to 'Completed' Folders)
                 http://ovh.ttdpatch.net/~jdrexler/rt/old/equal-operator.diff

                Built with CFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with CXXFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1
                Built with the following options:
                ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-debug --with-xmlrpc-c

                You should move the /usr/local/etc/.rtorrent.rc config file to your home directory!
                Check the configuration and create the proper directories! (/home/tc/.session for example)

                If you would like to use a good WebUI:
                Download ruTorrent via svn:
                 cd /usr/local/var/www/
                 svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rutorrent
                 cd /usr/local/var/www/rutorrent/
                 svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins
                Uncomment line: scgi_port = localhost:5000 in ~/.rtorrent.rc
                Configure your webserver to connect rTorrent via SCGI on port: 5000.
