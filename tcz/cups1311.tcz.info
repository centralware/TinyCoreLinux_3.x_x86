                foomatic-rip is now a separate extension for driver packages that use it
                ----------
                This version does not require a login 
                To start it, add the following line to /opt/bootlocal.sh
                     /etc/init.d/cups start
                Or run it from a terminal with 
                     sudo /etc/init.d/cups start | restart | status | stop
                ----------
                CUPS has a few built-in printers, but you probably want to add a
                driver package like HPIJS or Gutenprint
                ----------
                To detect and install a printer automatically, open the
                CUPS web interface at http://localhost:631 and select
                     Administration > Find New Printers
                ----------
                Add the following lines to /opt/.filetool.lst
                     etc/cups/printers.conf
                     etc/cups/ppd
                ----------
